# Keyed Transposition Cipher

This program implements a **Keyed Transposition Cipher**, a classical encryption technique that rearranges the characters of a message based on a keyword to produce a ciphertext.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the program on your computer:

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Python** installed on your system.  
You can verify your installation by running:
```bash
python --version
````

If Python is not installed, download it from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Setup

1. **Download** and **extract** the ZIP file containing the project.
2. **Import** the extracted folder into your preferred code editor (for example, VS Code or PyCharm).

---

### 3. Run the Program

Open a terminal in the project directory and execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

The program will start and prompt you for input to encrypt or decrypt messages using the keyed transposition cipher.

## About the Cipher

The **Keyed Transposition Cipher** works by rearranging the letters of your message according to a keyword.
Each keyword creates a unique transposition pattern, so the same message will produce different ciphertexts when encrypted with different keys.
